# Face-Recogniser-using-Transfer-Learning

Pre-trained base model used in this repo is VGG16 which used the ImageNet dataset. On top of this, I have created 3 Dense layers for the model to train.

Used '5 Celeb Dataset' which achieved an accuracy of 88% and also made a dataset of my family members that achieved >95% accuracy for this purpose.
